# Contributing
Contribution to the tla-wiki are very welcome! To contribute to this book, you will need a Github Account.

The best path to contribute to this wiki is to:
0. Check if anyone is already working on your same idea by checking [issues](https://github.com/FedericoPonzi/tlaplus-wiki/issues). 
1. Create an issue stating what page/contribution/fix you would like to contribute to, or find an unassigned issue you'd like to work on.
2. You can:
    * Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) to fork the [repo](https://github.com/FedericoPonzi/tlaplus-wiki) and create a pull request. This requires download the project locally, edit it and using git.
    * Use the web editor directly on github, as explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files). This flow is easier but it works well only for updating existing pages.

If you don't have a github account but still you'd like to contribute, please send the diffs via email to me. You can find my email at the bottom of my page [here](https://fponzi.me/).
