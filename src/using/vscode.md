# Visual Studio Code Extension
This is the fastest and easiest way to get started with TLA+ and TLC.

1. Download visual studio
2. Search for the tla+ plugin in the extensions tab.
3. Make sure to install TLA+ Nightly. It is usually stable, it has more features and extension release is lagging behind.

Additionally, you might want to enable automatic module parsing on saves: https://github.com/tlaplus/vscode-tlaplus/wiki/Automatic-Module-Parsing
