# Learning TLA+ and Model Checking

* [Specyfing systems](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html): by Leslie Lamport is still the reference book for TLA+ and its tools

* [The Specification Language TLA+](https://members.loria.fr/SMerz/papers/tla+logic2008.pdf): Another good manuscript by Stephan Merz explaining TLA+ specification language:  Sect. 2 introduces TLA+ by way of a first specification of the resource allocator and illustrates the use of the tlc model checker. The logic TLA is formally defined in Sect. 3, followed by an overview of TLA+ proof rules for system verification in Sect. 4. Section 5 describes the version of set theory that underlies TLA+, including some of the constructions most frequently used for specifying data. The resource allocator example is taken up again in Sect. 6, where an improved high-level specification is given and a step towards a distributed refinement is made. Finally,Sect. 7 contains some concluding remarks
