# TLA+ Wiki intro
Welcome to TLA+ wiki. This wiki was created in response to the [2024 TLA+ community survey](http://discuss.tlapl.us/pdfW4MH5_0fKx.pdf).
More specifically, it aims to address the following feedbacks:

1. **Difficulty Understanding Existing Codebase and Documentation**: Respondents note challenges in comprehending the existing codebase and documentation. The lack of clear structure and architecture documentation, as well as the complexity of the Java codebase, pose significant obstacles for newcomers.
2. **Navigation and Documentation**: Navigating the various TLA+ resources and finding relevant documentation is identified as a challenge. Respondents note scattered and sometimes non-existent documentation, making it difficult to find the most relevant resources and assistance.
3. **Documentation and Tooling**: There is a strong consensus on the need for improved documentation, particularly in the form of better organised and comprehensive resources. This includes better documentation for the entire project, better release cycles for all TLA+ tools, and centralised documentation on a website rather than PDFs.


The takeaway also sums up the mission of this wiki well:

> **Streamlining Documentation**: There's a clear demand for better-organised documentation and centralised resources with a more modern interface to cater to users' preferences for accessible and comprehensive guidance.
